# Facial-Recognition-Attendance-System
Here is a facial recognition attendance system implemented that can be used in various places.  
The exciting part of this project for me was using the Flet framework.  
This framework provided me with the ability to design a relatively good user interface (UI).


I also utilized DeepFace and the highly efficient and accurate SFace model for identity recognition.
This part was implemented inside a Docker container and functions like an API. It receives the user's facial image and returns the result in the form of the individual's personnel code.
